# Password-Generator

## Description

This is a Random Password Generator based on the choices of the user. There are 4 arrays where different character types are stored and where the password characters would be randomly chosen from. The user is prompted to choose the character length they would want in their password as long as it is more than 8 characters and less than 129 characters.

Once the user makes their selection, the randomly generated password is displayed as an alert message on the html document.

Doing this project has taught me the importance of for loops and conditional statements. Because that has enabled my logic to function correctly. Also, the math.random logic has enabled the characters in the array to be randomly selected.

## Usage
The user clicks the Generate password button and a prompt message pops up.

Once the user inputs a valid character between 8 and 128, the user answers confirm messages asking if they would like specific characters in their password. Once that is done the password is displayed as an alert message as shown below.
